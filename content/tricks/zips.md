Zips allow you, as the name suggests, to quickly zip from one place to another.  
There are currently two known ways of zipping, jet zips and walljump zips.

Jet zips, as the name suggests, are done only under liquids because the animations are slowed down enough to be able to morph after a walljump. It's a 3-frame window in order to pull it off and you have to walljump, morph and turn around.

An example of a Jet Zip:

Jet zips can lead to zip storage if you perform a zip but before moving to the other side, you have to ctivate the gravity suit so it's possible to activate the spider ball. The spider ball activation ends up resetting the timer for the zip to get released so you have to spam it in order to keep the zip.

An example of a method of getting oob thanks to zip storage:

TODO: add Long Range activation maps and clean this up


There's also the Gravitt Zip:
